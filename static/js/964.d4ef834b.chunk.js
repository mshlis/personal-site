Specifically, I am interested in the expansion and incorporation of Argumentation Mining methods within this domain. Before going back to school, I worked as a Software Engineer at Amazon and a Machine Learning Researcher at defense contractor, Systems and Technology Research (STR). Prior to that I graduated from UMass Amherst with a bachelors in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, where I also completed REUs in a span of fields from logic debugging and eigensolvers all the way to computer vision techniqes within the domain of hyperspectral imaging.\n  \n<br/>\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="/images/other/im_shaggy.png">\n  <br><b>Here is an image of "shaggy" old me :)</b>\n</p>\n<br/>\n  \nSome other fun stuff about me:  \n   - Always down for a good chess game\n   - My two favorite board games are Coup and Catan :D\n   - DC > Marvel (inequality only holds if we aren\'t including the cinematic universes)\n   - Favorite technical quote: "*variational inference is what you implement while you\'re waiting for your MCMC to converge*" - D.
