I am currently a PhD Student at Uconn under Professor Shiri Dori-Hacohen, studying how to use AI to detect and combat misinformation. Specifically, I am interested in the expansion and incorporation of Argumentation Mining methods within this domain. Before going back to school, I worked as a Software Engineer at Amazon and a Machine Learning Researcher at defense contractor, Systems and Technology Research (STR). Prior to that I graduated from UMass Amherst with a bachelors in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, where I also completed REUs in a span of fields from logic debugging and eigensolvers all the way to computer vision techniqes within the domain of hyperspectral imaging.
